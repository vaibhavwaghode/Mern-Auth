In this tutorial, I'll guide you through creating a full authentication system using the MERN stack. Below is a summary of the key steps weâ€™ll cover:

Backend Setup:

Project Setup: Initialize the project and set up the backend with Express.js and MongoDB.
Install Dependencies: npm install express mongoose bcryptjs jsonwebtoken cors nodemon
Create Server and Middleware: Set up the Express server, configure MongoDB, and create necessary middleware.
Create Routes and Endpoints: Develop and test routes for /login, /register, and /profile.
Create Models and Test APIs: Define MongoDB models and test the authentication APIs.
Frontend Setup:

Project Setup: Initialize the frontend using React.js, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.
Install Dependencies: npm install axios react-toastify react-router-dom.
Create Components and UI: Build components like Header, Home, Login, Register, and Profile, and set up routing.
Create Private Routes: Implement protected routes to secure the Profile page.
Protecting Routes:

To secure the routes, create a PrivateRoute.js component to handle access control for authenticated users.
This tutorial provides a complete guide to setting up and securing a MERN stack application with JWT. Follow along to build your authentication system from scratch!


Key Features:

Backend: Implementing RESTful APIs with Express.js.
Frontend: Building a responsive UI with React.js and Tailwind CSS.
Database: Storing user data in MongoDB.
Authentication: Managing JWT tokens for secure login, registration, and profile protection.
Protected Routes: Ensuring only authenticated users can access specific parts of your application.
